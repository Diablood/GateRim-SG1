## Current milestone
### 0.2.11-dev — Balance queen-origin Prim'ta acquisition

A rare storyteller incident can now provide one escaped Goa'uld queen after
day `30` when the player does not already control a living queen.

```text
escaped Goa'uld queen
    -> player control
    -> one immature Prim'ta symbiote per extraction
    -> one-day persistent extraction cooldown
```

The existing incubation basin still requires one immature symbiote and `10`
raw meat to mature one implantable Prim'ta larva. Local assisted maturation
remains gated by Goa'uld biotechnology research.

A forced C# rebuild is required for this milestone.

## Next development focus

- validate the rare queen-arrival incident, extraction ownership guard and
  one-day cooldown;
- consider specialized queen infrastructure and faction-linked acquisition
  separately.
