## Current milestone
### 0.2.3-dev-r3 — Fix provisional Goa'uld shirt reference

Naturally generated ordinary Goa'uld and System Lord hosts no longer appear
naked. Until dedicated Goa'uld clothing is designed, both host profiles use a
temporary vanilla outfit:

```text
pants
collared shirt
duster
```

The generated-host initializer also heals a narrow list of chronic biological
ailments immediately after attaching the persistent adult symbiote identity.

This includes conditions such as:

```text
bad back
frailty
cataracts
hearing loss
dementia
asthma
artery blockage
carcinoma
```

The cleanup is intentionally limited. It does not erase scars, missing body
parts or ordinary combat injuries. It only prevents naturally generated
Goa'uld hosts from starting with biological chronic conditions that their
adult symbiote should already have repaired.

Dedicated Goa'uld and System Lord apparel remains a later visual-production
milestone.

The `r3` startup fix replaces the invalid temporary shirt reference
`Apparel_ButtonDownShirt` with the vanilla `Apparel_CollarShirt` ThingDef.

## Next development focus

- validate clothed ordinary Goa'uld and System Lord hosts;
- confirm generated hosts no longer retain bad back or similar chronic ailments;
- confirm persistent symbiote identity remains stable after save and reload;
- keep direct raids Jaffa-only;
- add cultural backstories separately.
