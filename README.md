## Current milestone
### 0.1.78-dev — Add SG-team field uniform prototype

The first SG-team clothing baseline is now available:

```text
SG1_GenericSGTeamUniform
```

The prototype represents a lightweight olive-drab field BDU combining jacket
and trousers as one textile base layer. It covers torso, shoulders, arms and
legs without attempting to replace later modular equipment.

The uniform is:

- craftable at vanilla tailoring workstations;
- categorized under the dedicated `SG teams` apparel category;
- wearable on the `OnSkin` layer;
- intentionally low-protection compared with dedicated armor;
- supplied with temporary body-type and facing-specific graphics.

The following SG-team items remain separate planned milestones:

```text
SG tactical boots
SG tactical gloves
SG tactical vest
```

Environmental and role variants such as black, woodland, desert, heavy
tactical, medical and scientific uniforms remain deferred until the generic
baseline is validated.

Natural Goa'uld raids, settlements and traders remain disabled.

## Next development focus

- validate rendering across body types and facings;
- validate tailoring recipes and apparel compatibility;
- add SG tactical boots as the next modular equipment item.
