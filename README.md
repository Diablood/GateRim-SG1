- Required DLC for the current development branch: `Biotech`

## Current milestone
### 0.1.67-dev — Add retractable Jaffa helmet modes

The deployed Jaffa helmet now supports three persistent deployment modes:

- automatic: retracted outside draft, deployed while drafted;
- always deployed;
- always retracted.

Raw armor ratings remain identical in both positions. The deployed state
protects `FullHead`, while the retracted state protects `UpperHead`.

A worn-apparel gizmo cycles the mode, and a lightweight game component keeps
automatic deployment synchronized with draft state.

Automatic armor loadouts for generated Goa'uld-aligned Jaffa remain deferred.

## Next maintenance focus

Before the next gameplay expansion, the project will perform a consolidation pass:

- keep the five remaining French translation load errors identified as vanilla RimWorld issues;
- audit player-facing information, debug-only diagnostics and conditional gizmos;
- prepare a mod-specific debug option before the `0.2.x` Stargate chapter;
- preserve the future wiki-image and Workshop-asset plan without claiming final visuals yet.
